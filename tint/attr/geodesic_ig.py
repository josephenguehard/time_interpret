class GeodesicIntegratedGradients(GradientAttribution):
    r"""
    Geodesic Integrated Gradients.

    This method uses K Nearest Neighbors on the input data to approximate the
    geodesic path between inputs and reference baselines. The input space is
    seen here as a Riemannian manifold, whose metric is the inner product of
    the gradient of the model:

    .. math::
        <\nabla F(x)^T, \nabla F(x)>

    Using this path reduces the risk of creating artifacts compared with
    the original Integrated Gradients (IG). It also supports
    ``internal_batch_size`` for faster compute. The number of steps is also
    set by default to 5, as less steps are required between two neighbors.
    With this setting, and the number of neighbors set to 10, the number of
    gradients to compute is 10 * 5 = 50, the same number as the original IG.

    The shortest path is computed using Dijkstra or A* algorithms. This can
    be computationally expensive for a number of inputs greater than a few
    thousands.

    Args:
        forward_func (callable):  The forward function of the model or any
            modification of it.
        nn (NearestNeighbors, tuple): Nearest neighbors method.
            If not provided, will be created when calling __init__ or
            attribute.
            Default: None
        data (Tensor, tuple): Data to fit the knn algorithm. If not provided,
            the knn will be fitted when calling attribute using the provided
            inputs data.
            Default: None
        n_neighbors (int, tuple): Number of neighbors to use by default.
            Can be an integer (same for every inputs) or a tuple.
            Default: None
        multiply_by_inputs (bool, optional): Indicates whether to factor
            model inputs' multiplier in the final attribution scores.
            In the literature this is also known as local vs global
            attribution. If inputs' multiplier isn't factored in,
            then that type of attribution method is also called local
            attribution. If it is, then that type of attribution
            method is called global.
            More detailed can be found here:
            https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06104

            In case of integrated gradients, if `multiply_by_inputs`
            is set to True, final sensitivity scores are being multiplied by
            (inputs - baselines).

        This method attributes the output of the model with given target index
        (in case it is provided, otherwise it assumes that output is a
        scalar) to the inputs of the model using the approach described above.

        In addition to that it also returns, if `return_convergence_delta` is
        set to True, integral approximation delta based on the completeness
        property of integrated gradients.

        It also returns the curvature if `return_curvature` is set to True.

        Args:
            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which integrated
                gradients are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            baselines (scalar, tensor, tuple of scalars or tensors, optional):
                Baselines define the starting point from which integral
                is computed and can be provided as:

                - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                  exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                  dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                  with inputs.

                - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                  be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                  to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:

                  - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                    corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                    or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                    dimensions match with the corresponding
                    input tensor.

                  - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                    inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                    for corresponding input tensor.

                In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.

                Default: None
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                this is usually the target class).
                If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                no target index is necessary.
                For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                  integer, which is applied to all input examples

                - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                  the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                  is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                  elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                  examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                  #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                  target for the corresponding example.

                Default: None
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                are provided to forward_func in order following the
                arguments in inputs.
                For a tensor, the first dimension of the tensor must
                correspond to the number of examples. It will be
                repeated for each of `n_steps` along the integrated
                path. For all other types, the given argument is used
                for all forward evaluations.
                Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                to these arguments.
                Default: None
            n_neighbors (int, optional): Number of neighbors to use by default.
                Must be provided if it has not been set in the init.
                Can be an integer (same for every inputs) or a tuple.
                Default: None
            n_steps (int, optional): The number of steps used by the approximation
                method. Default: 5.
            n_steiner (int, optional): Add a certain number of steiner points
                into the graph. These points are added following the fixed
                scheme. For more information, please refer to the section 4.1.3
                of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10430.
                Default: None
            method (string, optional): Method for approximating the integral,
                one of `riemann_right`, `riemann_left`, `riemann_middle`,
                `riemann_trapezoid` or `gausslegendre`.
                Default: `gausslegendre` if no method is provided.
            internal_batch_size (int, optional): Divides total #steps * #examples
                data points into chunks of size at most internal_batch_size,
                which are computed (forward / backward passes)
                sequentially. internal_batch_size must be at least equal to
                #examples.
                For DataParallel models, each batch is split among the
                available devices, so evaluations on each available
                device contain internal_batch_size / num_devices examples.
                If internal_batch_size is None, then all evaluations are
                processed in one batch.
                Default: None
            return_curvature (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                the curvature or not. If `return_curvature`
                is set to True curvature will be returned in a tuple following
                attributions and optionally convergence delta.
                Default: False
            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                a tuple following attributions.
                Default: False
            distance (str, optional): Which distance to use with the A*
                algorithm:

                - 'geodesic': the geodesic distance using the gradients norms.

                - 'euclidean': using the plain euclidean distance between
                  points. This method amounts to the one described here:
                  https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02055-7

                Default: 'geodesic'
            show_progress (bool, optional): Displays the progress of computation.
                It will try to use tqdm if available for advanced features
                (e.g. time estimation). Otherwise, it will fallback to
                a simple output of progress.
                Default: False

        Returns:
            **attributions** or tuple with **attributions**, **delta** (optional) or /and curvature (optional):
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                Integrated gradients with respect to each input feature.
                attributions will always be the same size as the provided
                inputs, with each value providing the attribution of the
                corresponding input index.
                If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                corresponding sized tensors is returned.
            - **delta** (*tensor*, returned if return_convergence_delta=True):
                The difference between the total approximated and true
                integrated gradients. This is computed using the property
                that the total sum of forward_func(inputs) -
                forward_func(baselines) must equal the total sum of the
                integrated gradient.
                Delta is calculated per example, meaning that the number of
                elements in returned delta tensor is equal to the number of
                examples in inputs.
            - **curvature** (*tensor*, returned if return_curvature=True):
                The difference between the distance along the path computed
                by the A* algorithm and the euclidean distance between
                inputs and baselines. This value, always positive,
                returns a measure of the curvature of the input space, with
                the inner product of the gradient of the model:

                .. math::
                    <\nabla F(x)^T, \nabla F(x)>

                as a metric. A higher value indicates a higher curvature.
                This value however depends on the path and is as such only
                an indication of the true curvature of the input space.
